# lemming

Lemming is a suite of applications and scripts that are used for MySQL at OpenDNS. Most of these applications are built using the Go programming language and require basic knowledge on how to setup and install Go in an Ubuntu/Debian environment.

This project is in early Alpha stages. Please continue with caution.
